## Birefringent components of the eye

The human eye has three components that  are responsible for the birefringence. These are the Cornea, the macular retina (esp. Henle's layer) and the retinal nerve fiber layer.

1. The **Cornea** behaves like a flat retarder with widely varying retardation values that range from 0-0.25λ and 0.05λ being the mean. The slow visual axis is inclined nasally downwards by 10°-30° 
2. The dichroic **macular** pigment molecules act as dichroic polariser. As the concentrically aligned chainlike lutein molecules absorb polarization states depending on color and orientation it is best modeled as radial analyser. This layer is the reason why the Haidinger brush is blue-yellowish. The blue components are absorbed while the yellow part of the spectrum is transmitted to photoreceptor cells. The second function of the Henle layer is that it acts like a retarder. The photoreceptor's inner fibres retardation values range from 0.03λ to 0.05λ and the slow axis is radially orientated. As it is radial symmetric and therefore the principal axes are parallel or perpendicular to the polarization axis it has no effect on the light transmission.
3. The **retinal nerve fiber layer** also acts birefringent, but as it is absent from the central macular region it has no influence on the Haidinger brush.

The birefringent components are modeled by the use of the Müller formalism.
It is comparable to the Jones-formalism but also allows light to be only partly polarized. Here, the polarisation state of light is expressed  by a Stokes vector that consists of 4 entries. 
S0 descirbes the intensity, S1 the preference of horizontal polarization, S2 the preference for 45° polarization and S3 the preference for right circular polarization.
